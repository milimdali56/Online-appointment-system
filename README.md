Address, Phone, Car License number, Car Engine Number, appointment date and

i. In the list table admin is able to see the client name, phone, Car
registration number, appointment date, and mechanic name.
b. If admin wants he can change the date of appointment and also the assigned
mechanic name with any other available mechanic for any specific client.

The submitted data is stored in a database which is maintained on a server. The
webpage and the server communicate with each other at every step of the appointment
process. The list of the mechanic shows how many free places are available for each
mechanic. After a client makes data submission, it should check whether the client has already
taken any appointment from any mechanic on certain date or not. If not, then the client is
allowed to take an appointment otherwise s/he will be notifying that he has already taken anappointment on that specific date. And also if the mechanic is occupied with maximum no. of
appointment the system notifies the client otherwise it will approve the appointment.
